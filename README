Sheath Weapon is a ESO addon created by Kelnoreem
When out of combat, toggles the weapon to be sheathed. 

This addon was originally created as a learning tool for my daughter who was exploring software development as a college choice.  There were many topics and languges we explored besides ESO and LUA. I recently was informed the code used to originate this addon was copied from an addon called StowIt by stjobe in 2014.  When this addon was created, acknowledging to the original author should have been made.
